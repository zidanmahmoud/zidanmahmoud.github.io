Taucer, 1995*.\nThe simulation of reinforced concrete elements due to a seismic loading brings down the cost of physical experiments, however involves high non-linearities. Many implementation to tackle this problems have been established through the recent years. This thesis work shows the implementation of a flexibility-based fiber beam-column element to model the response of a reinforced concrete element under a cyclic loading in the post-yielding phase. The theory behind the element is discussed as well as the algorithm to carry on the solution. The element has been implemented in a stand-alone Python code and in the open-source framework Kratos, which is an open-source FEM framework developed in the chair of Structural Analysis in the Technical University of Munich, Germany, as well as in International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE) in Barcelona, Spain\n","date":1574294400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574294400,"objectID":"507fe3d599380df884ce4605ebd4c0ca","permalink":"https://zidanmahmoud.github.io/project/beamcolumn/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/beamcolumn/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis.","tags":["Structural Analysis"],"title":"Flexibility-Based Fiber Beam-Column Element to Model Reinforced Concrete Under Seismic Loading, Master Thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To address the computations of solid particles in a fluid flow, one has to solve the transient Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in the fluid domain with the imposition of no-slip boundary con- dition at the interface between the fluid domain and the solid object. One way to achieve this is by the application of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method, which combines the advantages of both Lagrangian descripton following an individual parcel as it moves through space and Eulerian description focusing on specific locations in the space. However, this method requires adaptive meshing depending on solid particles displacements as time evolves and therefore leads to a substantial computational cost. To avoid repeated re-meshing, the whole computational domain containing the fluid and the solid is meshed with a fixed structured cartesian grid. As a result, the grid will most probably not conform to the solids boundary. Here, the introduction of the solid phase to the governing flow equations is achieved by adequately formulating the source term marked in the NS equation.\n","date":1566950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566950400,"objectID":"d327d6df0ece93159ce6b982aa5d9e98","permalink":"https://zidanmahmoud.github.io/project/openfoam/","publishdate":"2019-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/openfoam/","section":"project","summary":"A Project of the course Simulation of Thermofluids with Open-Source Software.","tags":["CFD"],"title":"Immersed Boundary pisoFoam Solver","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wind Analysis of the high-rise building 1180 Peachtree, Atlanta, Georgia, US.
